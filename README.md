# Stock-Analysis 
VBA of Wall Street

# Overview
* We explored Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA, a programming language for Microsoft Office applications. Within the context of VBA, we learned core coding concepts that helped perform more complex analyses. 
* Create a VBA macro that can trigger pop-ups and inputs, read and change cell values, and format cells. Use for loops and conditionals to direct logic flow. Use nested for loops. Apply coding skills such as syntax recollection, pattern recognition, problem decomposition, and debugging.

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to compare the returns of 12 different stocks discovered. The goal of this study is to look at the stock market during the last few years in order to assist Steve in making financial decisions. VBA programs were used to help him simplify a massive amount of stock data. This stock market research focuses on the years 2017 and 2018. 

# Comparing the Results 

 * The collection of stocks had overall great performance in 2017 with a maximum return of 199.4%. After running the analysis TERP was the only stock underperforming with a negative return of -7.2% for the year 2017. When we fast forward to 2018 the stocks took a big dive leaving only two stocks out the tweleve the had a positive gain. The tickers ENPH and RUN are considered good investments due to the positive returns in 2018.

 # Summary 
 
 ## What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
 * Adding refactoring to your code can help you find potential bugs faster. It allows other programmers to critique your code to highlights errros. However, When working under pressure, programmers may be forced to choose between restructuring and writing new code. Refracting a stable code to can generate new errors. It also opens the door for confusion or getting lost within the code. 


 ## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
* Original code took longer to execute
* Refactored code is smoother 
* Refactored code easier to read
